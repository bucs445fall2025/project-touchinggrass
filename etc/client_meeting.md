### **Interview Questions & Responses**

#### **1. What are the costs vs. budget?**
**Client’s Response:**
Wants to request six hours of college student labor per week on building this project.

---

#### **3. What problem are you trying to solve?**
**Client’s Response:**
Want to play tretis game online but the other version websites have too many designs and ads, defeating the purpose of enjoying the game

**Clarification & Notes:**
- The real problem is tetris games is that they typically add on extraneous features that distract from the core gameplay. These features are often too commercialized because they try to make the game more branded (such as online multiplayer).
- Consider features like **UI improvements** such as customizable themes and different game modes and keeping the leaderboard feature (on a server).

---

#### **4. What is the most important feature?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Initiative tracking needs to be easy and automatic.")
The core classic tetris gameplay.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- This feature should be the **core focus** of the software.
Classic tetris gameplay with modern UI.
- Other features (e.g., dice rolling) are secondary.
Login and score saving is secondary, along with custom audio/visual effects.

#### **5. Is there a similar product on the market?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Yes, but they are either too complex or too expensive.")
Yes, but they are all too busy because they are focused on branding and marketing to attract a wider audience rather than core teris gameplay.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Competitor analysis needed.
- Find a way to differentiate: **Simpler UI? Free version? Customizable?**

---

#### **6. Are there any existing products or technologies that will need to be integrated?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "It would be nice if it worked with Roll20 or D&D Beyond.")
Yes, probably external server hsoting sofgtware.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Check for **APIs** for possible integrations.
- Consider a **manual import/export** feature if full integration isn’t feasible.

---

#### **7. What does success look like for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
If I can play a full game of tetris on this website, it's a win.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Nice bonuses: score tracking, player profiles, different game modes

---

#### **8. What risks are associated with a malicious user?**
**Client’s Response:**
- Someone could figure out a way to give themselves 99999 score and be permanently at the top of the leaderboard.
- Someone could hack into other people's accounts maybe, but there's not really anything harmful they could do from there.

**Clarification & Notes:**

**Clarification & Notes:**

**Client’s Response:**
- Global scoreboards
- Player profiles
- friends feature where you can follow people and see their scores
- Extra game modes: score attack, time attack
- T-spins working how they do in classic tetris would be cool

**Clarification & Notes:**

- T-spins will be either easy or difficult to implement, hard to say which

- **Secondary features:** Scoreboards, advanced gameplay like T-spins, extra game modes, profiles and friends

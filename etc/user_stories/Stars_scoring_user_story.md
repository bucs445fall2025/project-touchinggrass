# Scoring

## **User Story**
As a player, I want a star system sysem for scoring so that I can easily understand how well I did.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Each game mode must have a corresponding way that time and score translate into X/5 stars (to demonstrate progress/improvement)
- When the user finishes a game, a star rating for that game should appear on screen
- Number of stars should be stored in the DB for each score

---

## **Notes**
- We should have a nice animation for the stars appearing on screen when a game is finished
- [Potential risks or challenges]

# Basic tetris

## **User Story**
   As the client, I want the tetris game engine to be functional so I can attract players.
---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- There are multiple pieces, can move horizontally and vertically
- Pieces appear at the top of the screen and move down automatically at a certain speed
- Pieces can be rotated
- Pieces can be hard- or soft-dropped with the up or down keys respectively


---

## **Notes**
- when testing, adjust speed of soft drops. Make it feel good
- animation for rotating pieces?
- consider showing a window that shows the next upcoming piece

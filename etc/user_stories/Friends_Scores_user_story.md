## **Acceptance Criteria**
- [Define the success conditions for this feature]
- [How will we know when this is done?]
- [What must be functional before release?]
Eric Churchill is a user who wants to see all of his friend's scores, and challenge his friends through competitions. The success conditions are if all users can see their friends (ranked) scores against their score. We must be able to uniquely identify friend's ranked scores from database quickly.

## **Notes**
- [Any additional considerations or insights]
- [Potential risks or challenges]
We should be distinguishing between 1st, 2nd , and 3rd level connections (like with linkedin), to provide a better user experience.

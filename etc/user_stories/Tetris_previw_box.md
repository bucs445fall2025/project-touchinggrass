# Scoring

## **User Story**
As a player, I want to see what upcoming tetris block I will be using
to prepare for my next move

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Preview box should be located somewhere along one of the sides of the game window
- Should display the upcoming block: starting orientation and color

---

## **Notes**
- We should place the preview box on a good spot on the window to avoid any issues with gameplay
- Consider adding extra design to the preview window if time permits

# Game Feel

## **User Story**
- As an average gamer, I want the game to have a title screen with buttons so that I know what game I'm playing and what options I have.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Title screen should say "Tetris"
- Title screen should have several buttons
    - "Play" starts a new game
    - "Scores" shows the scoreboards
    - "Settings" shows the game settings
    - "Stats" shows how many games a user has played, what their personal high score is
    - "Friends" shows a list of the player's friends (if they are signed in), along with their friends' high scores
    - Not all of these buttons need to be present, but "Play" should be at least

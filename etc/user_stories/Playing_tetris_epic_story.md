# Scoring

## **Epic Story**
As a gamer, I want to play tetris so that I can have fun.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- All the basic mechanics of tetris should work.
    - rotating pieces
    - soft and hard drops
    - storing a piece (implement last)
- Player should be able to hit start and play a game

---

## **Notes**
- Eventually implement a scoring system, translate lines cleared into points
- [Potential risks or challenges]

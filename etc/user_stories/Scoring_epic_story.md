# Scoring

## **Epic Story**
As a gamer, I want to see my scores so I can tell if I'm improving.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Scores need to be stored and retrievable from the database
- Each user must be able to see their N most recent scores

---

## **Notes**
- Probably doesn't make sense to store every score forever
- [Potential risks or challenges]

# Basic tetris

## **User Story**
   As a player, I want the tetris pieces to have collision so I can stack blocks without them going through each other.
---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Each piece gets dropped until it lands on the bottom of the screen or another piece
- A piece cannot move horizontally or vertically through another piece
- A piece cannot move through the floor or walls of the main tetris game panel

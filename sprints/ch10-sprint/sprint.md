### Planning

- Following along with a tutorial we found on youtube, we will refactor our existing implementation of Tetris and complete the main gameplay loop (position/rotate/drop pieces, clear lines, more pieces appear at the top one by one).
- We will finish all documentation, SRS, README, Software Diagram, Testing, User Interface, Project Status (known bugs).

### Action Items

<< A list of things that need to happen in our for our team to complete the sprint >>

### Issues and Risks

- This is going to be a lot of work.
- It will be difficult to split the work up evenly, especially because it's all so intertwined.
- Whoever does most of the refactoring will have more information about the codebase than the people writing the documentation. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have everyone do the refactoring, that would be inefficient.
- Only thing to do here seems to be to buckle down and do as much individually as we each can.

### Team Work Assignments

We'll figure out who should do what as we go.

## Sprint 7 Planning

## Requirements Flex

4/5 requirement flexes remaining

### Requirement Target

- Tetris Piece Collision
- Game Embedded

### User Stories

- Piece_collision_user_story
- Website_user_story

### Action Items

- Implement tetris piece collision
- Embed the game in the website
    - Preferably do this within the docker containerized website

### Issues and Risks

- Getting Godot embedded in the website might not be possible, we might have to export the game to a web-friendly format and that might be complicated
- Getting the game to run in the container could be weird and difficult
    - We might (probably will) go to office hours for this

### Team Work Assignments

- Rachel: Implement tetris piece collision
- Stella and Luis: Embed the game in the website, ideally still containerized
